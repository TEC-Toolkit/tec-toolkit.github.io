# About

With the Net Zero agenda gaining significant traction across the world, organisations are often required to report carbon emissions associated with their operation. However, calculating emissions is not a trivial task and reported scores can differ depending on the choices made by those performing the calculations or the software used to assist with this task. This might include the methodology and conversion factors used to calculate the scores as well as the origin and accuracy of the input data (e.g., energy usage). The aim of this project is to provide ontology models and software tools to formalise provenance of carbon footprint calculations in a machine-understandable knowledge graphs to enhance the transparency of such process. We argue that such provenance metadata is crucial in supporting assessments of emission scores' veracity and trustworthiness, as well as improving the understandability of the calculated scores so they can be meaningfully integrated with other results across the supply chains.
