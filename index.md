# About

With the Net Zero agenda gaining significant traction across the world, organisations are often required to report carbon emissions associated with their operation. However, calculating emissions is not a trivial task and reported scores can differ depending on the choices made by those performing the calculations or the software used to assist with this task. This might include the methodology and conversion factors used to calculate the scores as well as the origin and accuracy of the input data (e.g., energy usage).
The aim of this project and this open source initiative is to provide ontology models and software tools to formalise provenance of carbon footprint calculations in a machine-understandable knowledge graphs to enhance the transparency of such process. We argue that such provenance metadata is crucial in supporting assessments of emission scores' veracity and trustworthiness, as well as improving the understandability of the calculated scores so they can be meaningfully integrated with other results across the supply chains.

The TEC toolkit consists ontologies for modelling ECFs in KGs and describing provenance traces of emissions calculations, public Knowledge Graphs built from open data with over 42400 ECFs, and the Semantic Machine Lerning Impact Calculator.

# How to Use this Resource

[ECFO](/#the-emission-conversion-factor-ontology-ecfo) and [PECO](/#the-provenance-of-emission-calculations-ontology-peco) ontologies may be use together or separately. For example, the [Emissions Conversion Factors KG](/#emissions-conversion-factors) uses ECFO and can be used as a look up database of conversion factors. 

PECO may be used to describe the emission calculation process, which typically also involves the conversion factors and hence the combination of PECO and ECFO may be desired. Semantic Machine Learning Impact calculator is a prototype software that demonstrates how PECO and Emissions Conversion Factors KG can be embedded within a web-based application. 

For further information on ECFO and PECO follow the w3id link that will let you download the ontologies and/or view the online documentation. 

Please see the [SMLI Calculator](/#smli-calculator) for a link to online demo and source code to further explore how the individual components of the TEC toolkit might be integrated in a software application.

# Software

## SMLI Calculator

The [Semantic Machine Lerning Impact Calculator](https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/Semantic_Machine_Learning_Impact_Calculator) is an extension of the [Machine learning Impact (MLI) calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact\#compute) with semantic components to perform the emission calculations.

***SMLI Demo*** 

https://calculator.linkeddata.es  
(currently only Chrome is supported)


***How it works*** 

SMLI Calculator queries the live ECFO KG to retrieve the information about the available conversion factors that match the user input. 

An example call to [Java-based backend](https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/Semantic_Machine_Learning_Impact_Calculator/blob/main/src/main/java/io/github/tectoolkit/calculator/Controller.java) that queries the ECFO KG for corresponding conversion factors:

````
fetch('/cf_info_all?region=' + region)
		.then((response) =>
			response.json()
		)
		.then((CF_data) => {
			
			....
			
			})
````


A SPARQL query executed to retrieve conversion factors for a specific region of compute:

The calculator also produces JSON-LD descriptions of provenance traces documenting the individual steps of emissions calculation process. [JSON-LD context](https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/Semantic_Machine_Learning_Impact_Calculator/blob/main/src/main/resources/static/js/tec-context.js) and set of custom [JavaScript Functions](https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/Semantic_Machine_Learning_Impact_Calculator/blob/main/src/main/resources/static/js/tec-lib.js) are used to query ECFO KG to retrieve the information about the Emission Conversion Factors and to generate portion of the provenance trace. 

An example of generating description of activity with a connected input entity in the [code that calculates the emissions](https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/Semantic_Machine_Learning_Impact_Calculator/blob/main/src/main/resources/static/js/grayscale.js): 

````
	let wattConsumption = createCalculationEntity("Watt Consumption", state.gpus[gpu].watt, "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q25236", "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1053879", graphLD, "")
	
	let electricityUseEstimate = createCalculationActivity("https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/Semantic_Machine_Learning_Impact_Calculator", "Estimate Electricity Use in kW/h", graphLD)
	
	linkInputEntityToActivity(wattConsumption, electricityUseEstimate, graphLD)
````

The calculator also executes a number of validation queries, for example, to check if the latest available conversion factor is up to date:

PREFIX  time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>

SELECT DISTINCT  ?cf ?cf_value ?time
WHERE
  { ?entity  rdf:type  peco:EmissionScore .
    ?entity prov:wasGeneratedBy/prov:used ?cf .
    ?cf (ecfo:hasApplicablePeriod/time:hasEnd)/time:inXSDDate ?time .
    ?cf  rdf:value  ?cf_value
    FILTER ( ?time < now() )
  }
````

The provenance trace can be also downloaded by the user.

## Data Validation

The [Data Validation component](https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/Data-Validation) runs Datalog rules to detect violations of conditions according to ECFO.
